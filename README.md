jsconsole
=========

This jsconsole is a heavily modified Fork of Remy's jsconsole with some quality of life improvements.

I put this project up on GitHub prematurely to make myself feel bad about the lack of documentation.

I have to clean up the source code a bit and document how you might use the library.

These changes are coming within the next week or so.
